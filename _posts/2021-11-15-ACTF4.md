# Introduction
On Saturday, November 13th 2021, myself, @redgate, and @F4_U57 participated in the attack-defence style CTF under the team name **sashimi**. The CTF lasted for a total of 4 hours, however, teams were allowed access to their game box 30 minutes prior to the official start time. This being an advantage we could not pass up, the team decided to meet an hour prior to the games official start to discuss game mechanics and strategy. When it was 30 minutes prior to the games start, we all connected to the box and began our play.
