This is a writeup about the `ACTF3` hosted by @fish at Arizona State University

Additionally, I would like to thank:
  - @redgate for offering his time and expertise during the CTF
  - @mahaloz for bringing the oppertunity to us, along with communicating with @fish to get the ok for us (myself, @redgate, and @F4_U57) to play
  - @fish for allowing us to play, and for organizing these CTF's

# Introduction
On Saturday, November 13th 2021, myself, @redgate, and @F4_U57 participated in the attack-defence style CTF under the team name **sashimi** where we got 3rd place overall. The CTF lasted for a total of 4 hours, however, teams were allowed access to their game box 30 minutes prior to the official start time. This being an advantage we could not pass up, the team decided to meet an hour prior to the games official start to discuss game mechanics and strategy. When it was 30 minutes prior to the games start, we all connected to the box and began our play.

# Game Description
The game works by having a number of teams with duplicate game boxes hosting some services, of which contain vulerabilities. It is each teams objective to capture `flags` from other teams servers, while protecting their own. To accomplish this, teams find exploits in their own services, patch it on their own machine, and exploit it on another. 

# Getting Connected and Game Setup
To get connected to the game box, each team was provided a private `ssh-key.key` along with a `ssh host` to connect to via `ssh`. Upon connection, the user is prompted with the following message:

> All services are running insider their own Docker containers. Their ports are mapped to the host, starting from 10001.
> 
> Each challenge is located at /opt/ictf/services inside its directory. You may modify the files inside to patch your services.

First thing first, @redgate advised us to make a recursive copy of the `/opt/ictf` directory to our home (`~`) directory. That way, if anything went wrong or we got super pwnd, we could recover. After this, I began taking a look at the services that we were provided with, of which there were three:

- `mommyservice` : a baby naming service
  - Service provided via a python script
- `bl4ckg0ld` : a coffee recipe service
  - Service provided via a binary
- `dungeon` : a text based adventure game
  -  Service provided via a binary

My teammate @F4_U57 began working on the `mommyservice`, I thought it would be best to split our efforts. Therefore, I began looking into `bl4ckg0ld` first, along with setting up defensive surveying on our server.

# Eyes on the stream - TCP monitoring
Before the game began, @fish was kind enough to remind everyone of the `tcpdump` command. Specifically:
```
tcpdump -i tun0 -w /tmp/<filename> -G 300 -C 100 -K -n "tcp port <port#>"
```
With this command, we are able to monitor the traffic that is comming into our server on a specific port, an invaluable tool to see what other teams are trying to do. The command, however, does hold the command line hostage until it has finished collecting. Therefore, it is recommended to either have a multiplexed terminal to have many going at once, to background the command, or to have a tmux session to handle the command.

Once enough information has been collected, we can copy the file (`/tmp/<filename>` from the aformentioned command) to our local machine to analyze. I personally used the WireShark software, as recommended by @redgate, and it proved to serve me well. 

# Ongoing Defence

Though I am not going to explicitly mention it, throughout this entire process, I was analyzing tcp dumps to monitor what other teams were doing to our services. In doing so, I had to divide my attention from doing analysis on our services, to downloading tcp dump files (using the `scp` command) to my local machine, to run through WireShark. Within WireShark, I would then look for the FLG string (since I know flags in this CTF begin with this) to see if any flags were captured from our server. If they have been, I could look at what the other team's input was and reverse engineer their exploit. **Note:** not all flag captures are done by other teams, there are bots that check for flags and service status on each teams box. Therefore, when looking at the TCP stream, we also have to check whether the input was from one of these bots that know the passwords to access the flags, or from another team exploiting.

# bl4ckg0ld
`bl4ckg0ld` is a service that allows users to write and read "recipes", it is loosly based on Starbucks. The file is served through a binary executable (ELF file) that is called `Bl4ckG0ld`. Given that it is a binary executable, to properly do analysis on it, we need to decompile it. The tool that I used and I recommend is `Ghidra`, which will decompile the file and display it in C code along side assembly.
## Analysis
For the sake of brevity, I will refrain from posting the actual decompiled code within this writeup. What is neccessary to know is that there are three effective functions:

- `brew(char* a, char* b, ushort len)`: A function that "brews" a recipe.
- `add_recipe()`: A function that writes a recipe to memory
- `print_recipe()`: A function that prints the content of a recipe, given a password and ID

For the sake of getting flags, the `print_recipe()` is the most obvious method to exploit. Issue is, we won't be able to get the password, nor will we really know the recipe ID (flag file name), so there isn't any immediate vulnerabilities that shine in this routine. There is, however, a glaring exploit in the `add_recipe()` function. For, within the file, we have both a user input with a size that is larger than the buffer, and a call to a `new_file(char* filename, char* content)` function that does an unchecked writes bytes to a file.

Exploit is a possible buffer overflow because `content[400]` and `password[40]`, while the scanf (highlighted) takes in 500 bytes for the content and 50 for the password

Has no checks on file overwrites, and uses write bytes (`wb`), which will overwrite files.

## Exploit / Getting Exploited
Unfortunately, though we were able to find the exploit present in the `add_recipe()` function, and the potential way to capture a flag in the `print_recipe()` function, we did not act fast enough. While I was decompiling the binary and analyzing it, I quickly took a moment to analyze another TCP dump file which I had watching the `bl4ckg0ld` service. After inserting the file into WireShark, I searched for the string FLG (since I knew all the flags began with this) to see if we had any compromises. Unfortunately, we had.

*image of WireShark showing that a FLG was sent from our service*

![Image of WireShark analyzing TCP stream](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71113694/142069635-0525773a-1994-4a55-a8d4-605619e40155.png)

This shows that we were exploited, and we had a flag stolen. To find this, I searched for the term `FLG` (converted to hex) within WireShark. Of course, in practice, make sure to inspect the stream and ensure that the input was from another user exploiting the service rather than a game bot.

*image of the TCP Stream that was used to exploit our service*

This confirms our suspicions that the exploit (at least the most obvious one) is a buffer overflow in the `add_recipe()` function. We know that the function being used is the `add_recipe()` function because the user inputed an 'A' first. Then the massive byte dump is standard for a buffer overflow. Then there is some shellcode injection that prints the flag for the attacker. Additionally, this attack was particularily malicious since after the attack, the flags on our server were also overwritten with A's and other junk. This also confirms the suspicions on the unchecked write function `new_file(char* filename, char* content)`.

*image of our flags on the server after the above exploit was completed*

The unfortunate part of this is that despite us now knowing the exploit, and having the input that was used to against us, other users were already being attacked by this and having their flags overwritten - making them useless to us. The best we can do is protect ourselves from future attacks to keep our services up for future ticks.

## Patch

The patch is to fix the buffer overflow in the `add_recipe()` function, particularily, the `scanf` input. In which, all we have to do is change the `%50s` and the `%500s` down to 40 and 400 respectively, to match the size of the buffers. **Note:** we don't have to worry about anything else because the `scanf` function will only read till these bounds or a null character is read. To do this, a binary file editor is recommended, I however I did not have one at the time, so I did it in `Vim`. This is doable since the `scanf` function uses a string to format its input, which will preserved in the binary.

Note that I believe this patch to work, as throughout the competition, checking the TCP stream showed that there were no more flag captures on our `bl4ckg0ld` service. Additionally, our flags were no longer being overwritten with A's and junk.

# dungeon

As mentioned before, this service is a text based adventure game. Again, this is served through a binary, therefore it has to be decompiled (I'm using Ghidra). The grip, of which, is that the user is tasked to answer trivial questions such as solutions to simple math problems, or to identify different military aircraft (represented through ascii art). Answering wrong results in the characters death, and the session ending.

## Analysis

The game is based on a finite state machine in the form of a `switch` statement within a `do-while` loop in the main function. Through this, we can easily create a finite state machine graph to help us in analyzing the program.

*image of the `switch` statement in the main game loop*

![Image of the decompiled game loop of dungeon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71113694/142087628-15098e53-cf4e-4d1f-98d6-f9186a195140.png)

The program is based on generating random values to handle the question and answers for the game. These random values are generated through C's `rand()` function, which is seeded with `srand(Time(NULL))` at the beginning of the main function. This gives itself to a time-based attack, since we know that the servers should have low - consistent - latency between each other. Through this, we can write a C++ or C script that should be able to generate the same numbers as the `rand()` function being used in the program. We could then use standard output of the script redirected into the input of the `netcat` session to traverse the game for us. I did this and it consistently worked to get met through the game and to the dragon, however, the program seemed to unfortunately be unsolvable (forshadowing).

## Exploit

What appeared to be the intended solution seemed to be to use another buffer overflow to jump to a statement that would print the contents of a flag to standard output. The overflow would be achieved by killing the dragon, which then calls a function that reads in the users name. However, the size of the name buffer is 84 `auStack116 [84]`, while the name read in function allows for a size of `0x78` or 120 in decimal.

*image of the name reading function, it shows that the function reads to the size of `param3` or till a null character is reached*

## Error in the Program

Now, the issue with this challenge and why it doesn't seem to be solvable, is because we can never kill the dragon - and thus, never reach a possible buffer overflow. This is because in the dragon state of the game machine, there is a global variable called `DAT00405a70` which has to be set to `0` in order for the dragon to be killable. I presume this is supposed to happen when the player recieves a shield from a dwarf. However, in that method, nor any other is the value of `DAT00405a70` changed. This leads to the unfortunate result that the problem became unsolvable (at least through the normal means). This concern was later confirmed through a message from @fish near the end of the game.

*image of the dwarf state, where we can see nothing is changed in the state machine if the user gets the shield*

May it be known as well, that throughout the game I was again checking TCP streams to see if anyone was exploiting this service. To my suprise, there were none. This also led me to the conclusion that maybe there was in issue with the program itself.

# Conclusion

Overall, my first attack-defence CTF was a blast, and I can't wait to play some more. Throughout the process, I learned that defence is probably one of the more underated aspects for teams to focus on - particularily the TCP dump and stream scanning. For, though it doesn't find you the exploits first, it helps you find the exploits in programs, and allows you to copy the exploit used on you against other users. Additionally, I think that patching should be prioritised when applicable. For, our team was aware of the issue in the `bl4ckg0ld` service for a bit before I saw the overwrite exploit being used against us. Being more proactive in patching the issue immediantly could have saved us some flags, and had the attack been more malicious, perhaps the game. Other than that, getting familiar with tools such as WireShark and Ghidra were invaluable to dealing with TCP streams and decompiling binaries.

Thank you for reading my writeup, and thanks again to @F4_U57, @redgate, @mahaloz, and @fish!
